# Taylor-Swift-Final-Project_1
This is my final for my Statistics class that looks at the overall tone/mood of Taylor Swift songs. I specifically looked at connotation of songs, the genres, the energy and whether or not it was a new or old song. These variables would help lead me to an answer.
# **Instructions**
To access and ultilize this script, open the "final_project_script.R" file, which contains the code to my findings. To access the dataset, open the "Amanda Volk Operationalization Project Variables - Sheet1 (3).csv.
# **Data**
The data for this specific analysis was gathered by looking at a total of 30 different Taylor Swift songs from various albums. Using the observations and creating a code will show the overall tone/mood of Taylor Swift songs and what might exactly affect it. Each unit of analysis was one song and there were 4 variables (two quantitative and two qualitative) variables that were observed. The sampling strategy I used was the simple random sampling strategy to ensure there were no biases when picking the songs.

One song was looked at at a time and the variables: connotation_of_song, genre_of_song, energy_of_song and new_vs_old_song, were carefully considered when evaluating the selected song.
#**Operationilization**
The concept of the connotation of the songs which relates to the overall tone/mood was operationalized by using qualitative coding scheme. It was measured with the words "positive", "neutral" and "negative". This variable really considered the lyrics but also the beat of the song as well.

The concept of the genre of the songs which relates to the overall tone/mood was operationalized by using qualitative coding scheme. It was measured with the words "country", "pop" and "rap". This variable was the most factual rather than opinion. I specifically looked at what the genre of the song was when listening to the song. Knowing the genre could help us detect any patterns that Taylor Swift may have in her music.

The concept of the energy of the songs which relates to the overall tone/mood was operationalized by using quantitative coding scheme. It was measured on a scale from 1-10. 1 would mean that the song was slow and not upbeat whereas a 10 would mean super upbeat and fast. This variable really just listened to the beat of the song; not the lyrics persay.

The concept of new versus old songs which relates to the overall tone/mood was operationalized by using quantitative coding scheme. It was measured by using the binary values of 0 and 1. 0 meant that it was over 4 years old (2020 and back) whereas 1 meant it was made 2021-present. This variable looked at the release year on the specific song.
